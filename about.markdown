# Hi! I'm Taufiq
Embarking on my journey, I joined a fast-track program that allowed me to commence college while still in the eleventh grade. Pursuing a dual degree from the University of Arizona and Sampoerna University in Industrial Engineering, I began immersing myself in the professional world early on. During my university years, I delved into roles such as a system analyst intern in food and beverage SMEs and a product manager intern at a B2B services-focused OTA company. Upon graduation, I dedicated my efforts to Alodokter, a pioneering telemedicine startup in Indonesia, where I specialized in enhancing e-commerce services and refining machine learning algorithms. Expanding my horizons, I briefly explored the realm of recruitment agencies before returning to my passion for startups. Currently, I thrive in an agritech startup environment, contributing to the realization of circular vision and zero-waste initiatives at Kecipir.

My passion lies in the realm of data, where I excel in tasks ranging from meticulous data cleaning to crafting insightful data visualizations and dynamic dashboards. I find joy in extracting meaning from raw data and transforming it into actionable insights. Proficient in tools such as Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, SQL, and Python, I leverage these skills to unlock the potential within datasets and drive informed decision-making.

As I continue to navigate my career path, I am actively seeking opportunities where I can apply my expertise not only to contribute to organizational growth but also to save towards pursuing my master's degree. I am eager to embark on new challenges and collaborations that will further enrich my skill set while making a meaningful impact.
